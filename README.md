## Introduction 
First of all, my name is Hamza Frejat, I was born in 1997, I completed my electrical engineering studies from Yarmouk University

## What I learned :
 
- Enhancing the user experience by clarifying the goal of the program and facilitating the process of dealing with it through easy and attractive designs that are free of complexity and have meaningful functions.

- This is done through the developer's full understanding of the purpose of the program
- The programmer must have a future view of the work he is doing, so he must coordinate and simplify the program to facilitate its maintenance in the future
- The programmer should have a future view of the work so that other developers can work on it
